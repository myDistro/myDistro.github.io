Hibernation is a nice feature for you're laptop.
I already created a [hibernation module](https://github.com/mrVanDalo/laptop-puppet/tree/master/modules/hibernate) but did not put it in here so far. 

* [Debian Hibernation Documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/Hibernation)
* [Debian Hibernation without Swap Partition](https://wiki.debian.org/Hibernation/Hibernate_Without_Swap_Partition) explains a bit about encryption.
