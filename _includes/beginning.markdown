Linux and other Unix systems most of the time come with a very good package managment system supported by puppet.
Because of that we don't need a library like [boxen](http://boxen.github.com) to install .dmgs. 

Our goal is to provide puppet modules to install laptops or desktop computers using puppet.
If you have a Mac you should have a look at [boxen](http://boxen.github.com)

We don't have an interface or something right now, actually you don't need one. 
Right now there are just 2 small modules which can help to reduce problems.
